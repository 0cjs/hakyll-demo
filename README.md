hakyll-demo
===========

This is a demo of the [Hakyll] static site build system. It was set up
according to the [tutorials].

Installing [Stack] and [installing Hakyll] will take some time, so
you'll probably want to kick this off first:

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
    stack upgrade   # Perhaps not necessary
    stack install hakyll
